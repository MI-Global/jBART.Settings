For porting MIUI from other device on the same platform:

1. Place here your stock ROM.zip (for recovery) file.

2. Edit file  Port_*.cfg for your platform (e.g. Port_mt6592.cfg). You can use any file name for this file.
   If there is no such config for you platform it will be great to make it and make pull request to share.

3. Run Port_Your_ROM.bat Your_ROM.zip Port_*.cfg (change Port_*.cfg to your platform config filename and Your_ROM.zip to your stock ROM's filename).
   After that you can see all nessesary files for porting in [ jBart-master\_local_repo\replace\device ] folder. You may add here all files you want to see in output ROM.

4. Go to translation and patching MIUI.


For translating and patching MIUI for your device:

1. Place input official MIUI ROM.zip in [ jBart-master\_input_miui ] forder. Better delete other zip files from this folder.

2. Run Recompile.bat without any options.

3. Go have your beer.

4. After recompiling the MIUI for your device will be located in [ jBart-master\output ] folder.

5. Search the jBart's log for copiling errors.
